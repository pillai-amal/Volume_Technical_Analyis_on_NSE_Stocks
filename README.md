# Volume_Technical_Analyis_on_NSE_Stocks
This script is one of earliest protype into technical analysis, where I create a scatter plot and daily top gainers to study whether the price is actually due to increase in delivery volume. In other words if there is an accumulation happening for the stock is it just due to seller pressure. 

Please feel free to contribute to this project

Here is a sample scatter plot created for ticker : HINDALCO

#this is my first prototype  in creatig a timeseries for technical analysis of indian stocks.
#for simplicity and performance I would suggest to use this https://github.com/pillai-amal/NSE-timeseries-form-CSV-file-creator-and-SQL-appender-
#uploaded as this shows a alternative way the timeseries are ceated from stored list of dictonaries. I have not seen this method implimented elsewhere
#although this is faster than make_timeseries function used in https://github.com/pillai-amal/NSE-timeseries-form-CSV-file-creator-and-SQL-appender- this is memory intensive
